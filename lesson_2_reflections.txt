What happens when you initialize a repository?
Why do you need to do it?
Resp: At the moment I initialize a repository a hidden folde named .git is created. 
I need to initialize a repository so I can take snapshots (commits)
of the various files and subfolders of that folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is where I put the files I'm interested in it's tracking,
whereas the working directory shows all the files, tracked or not.
The value of this is to pinpoint only the files needed to be tracked by git.
