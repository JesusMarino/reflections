When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Resp: I would use a remote repository whenever I need to share the contents of the repository, or if I start a collaborative project.
Also a remote reporsitory facilitates managing the files from different computers.
Lastly, a remote repository offers an easy way to backup the data concerning the repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Resp: It gives me more control over the versions of my files.
