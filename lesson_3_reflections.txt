When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Resp: I would use a remote repository whenever I need to share the contents of the repository, or if I start a collaborative project.
Also a remote reporsitory facilitates managing the files from different computers.
Lastly, a remote repository offers an easy way to backup the data concerning the repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Resp: It gives me more control over the versions of my files.

Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?
Resp: A fork is pretty much like a clone that exists on GitHub.
A clone is the exact copy of a git repository. 
A branch is paralel version of files inside one repository.
I would use a fork when I want to use a repository on GitHub
 but don't want my changes reflected on the original repository.
 
 What is the benefit of having a copy of the las known state of the remte stored locally?
 Resp: the copy of the last known state of the remote acts as a branch, so, when there's
 differences between the actual remote repository and the local repository, that local copy
 of the last known remote status will be used to resolve the conflicts.
